### I18n

- When doing translations, if you have a language you are not familiar with, you can use another language that you have translated and point out what language you cannot translate in the pull request.

- **Please MANUALLY MAINTAIN the i18n files!!!** Do not use `i18n Ally` or other extensions to maintain them. I know you might be confused or might not like this, but using `i18n Ally` for the maintenance will make it uncertain where to place the translations afterward or delete the code comments.
